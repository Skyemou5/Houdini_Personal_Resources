""" Cuts up incoming geometry """

This node is the TOP version of the [Multi Bounding Box|Node:sop/labs--multi_bounding_box] node. Useful for cutting up large pieces of geometry to do operations in parallel.

@parameters
    Output:
        The type of geometry to produce. Sliced geometry will return the cut up geometry, while bounding box will give you the bounding box per slice.
    Divisions:
        The number of divisions to cut up the incoming geometry.
    == Storage ==
    Set Item Index To:
       Determines what the output work-item index is set to.
    Store Geometry As:
       Where to keep the loaded geometry.
    External File Path:
       The file path to which to write the geometry data.
    External File Tag:
       The file tag to apply to the output file.
    Attribute Name:
