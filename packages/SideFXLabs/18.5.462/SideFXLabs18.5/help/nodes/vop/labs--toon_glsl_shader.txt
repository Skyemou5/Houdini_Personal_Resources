This toon shader is for preview purposes so that you can dial in your textures before exporting to your game engine

@parameters
    Light Position:
        Reference the translate values from your main light source for the parameter.
    Light Colour:
        Reference the light colour values from your main light source for this parameter
    Light Intensity:
        Reference the light intensity value from your main light source for this parameter
    Threshold:
        The point at which light and shadow meet on the surface based on the fresnel bewteen the normal and light position
    Base Colour:
        Colour of the surface when hit by direct light
    Tint:
        Colour of the surface in the shadow area. This is a multiplier of the base colour.
    Emission Colour:
        Colour based on the emission attribute on the points.
    Emission Texture:
        A texture to modulate the emission values.
    UV Scale:
        Control the uv scale of the emission texture.
    Use Normal Texture:
        Toggle the normal texture on and off.
    Normal Texture:
        Texture combines with point normals to create the final normal value of the surface.
    Normals Texture Scale:
        Control the strength of the normal texture.
    AO Texture:
        The ambient occlusion texture modulates the threshold value.
    AO Texture Scale:
        Control the strength of the ambient occlusion texture.
