""" Generates a blackbody ramp, or colorizes a black and white image with a blackbody ramp """

Helper node to generate a Blackbody ramp using the same logic as the Pyro Shader, which is slightly different than the blackbody vop. 


@parameters
    Override Size:
        Ignore the file native's size and use the specified one instead
    == Global Look Controls ==
    Pyro Shader Method:
        Selects between using the logic used by the Pyro Shader or the built in Blackbody VOP
    tonemap:
        The blackbody algorithmâ€™s output has a huge dynamic range.
    Gamma:
        Additional gamma control to tonemap the output image 
    == Temperature Controls ==
    temperature low:
        The temperature corresponding to an input value of 0.
    temperature high:
        The temperature corresponding to an input value of 1. For example, if this parameter is 5000 (the default), then an input value of 1 means a temperature of 5000 degrees Kelvin.
    == Intensity Controls ==
    adaptation:
        Squashes or stretches the low end of the generated intensity, similar to exposing a photograph for shadows.
    burn:
        Manipulates the high end of the generated intensity.
    Ramp Intensity:
        Multiplier on the ramp values
    Clip Value:
        Value of the image where the fade to black begins
