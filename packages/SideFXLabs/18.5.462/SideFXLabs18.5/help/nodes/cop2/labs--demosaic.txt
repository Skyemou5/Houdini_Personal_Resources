""" Converts a single mosaic (flipbook/subuv) image into a sequence of sub images based on the frame """

A Flipbook image is a common technique of packing multiple frames into a single 2d image. In Houdini we use the [Mosaic SOP|Node:cop2/mosaic] node for that. 

This node does the reverse, it takes a mosaic style image and breaks it back out into the original frames. 


@parameters
    Rows:
        Number of frames expressed vertically
    
    Columns:
        Numbers of frames expressed horizontally

    Frame:
    	Value of the current frame, usually $F 
    
    Start Frame:
        Value of the first frame in the sequence
