""" Generates a texture that can be used as a simple resolution checkerboard """

Generates a texture that can be used as a simple resolution checkerboard to compare texeldensities with.
It can also be used as a simple checkerboard by disabling most options on the tool.

@parameters
    Resolution:
        Resolution of the image. Increasing this resolution will also increase the tiling amount to produce a consistent number of checkers per pixel.
    Grid Tiling Multiplier:
	Allows you to increase the tiling amount of the checkerboard. By default the tool will produce 4 squares per 512 pixels.
