""" A Simple Node That Overlays 2 Normal Maps together """

This simple node adds 2 normal maps together. 

You are able to dive into this node and see inside the copfilter what formula we are using for adding the 2 masp togther. 

The general idea is that we move both normal maps into -1 to 1 space, add them together, normalize the result, and move things back to 0-1 space.
