""" Reads in DDS (DirectDraw Surface) Files """

This COP will read in DDS files. These files are common in games development, usually used as compressed game ready textures. 

NOTE:
	This COP leverages the PySide library to read the DDS files, and supports the same features PySide2 supports. 

WARNING: 
	Unfortunately, due to it being a Python node, this might not be as fast as a native implementation. 
	If you find yourself using this node a lot and would benefit from the speed up, reach out to support@sidefx.com 

NOTE:
	Currently there is no way of exporting DDS files. If this is important to you, please log an RFE with support@sidefx.com

@parameters
    Image:
        Path to the DDS Image File 
    Override Size:
