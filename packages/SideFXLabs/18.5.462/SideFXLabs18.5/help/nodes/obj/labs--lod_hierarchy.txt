""" Create and export an LOD Hierarchy as FBX """

The LOD Hierarchy tool allows you to plug in a set of OBJ nodes that should be exported as an LOD Hierarchy. The exporting process happens using FBX.
The input strip of this node can take in as many inputs as desired. On the parameter interface you can also manually reorder the input order.
