""" The Vertex Animation Textures ROP will export a mesh and textures to be used with a realtime material that can playback complex animations for cloth, rigid body destruction, fluids and particles. """

Vertex Animation Textures are an alternative method for playing back complex simulations in your game engine. The advantage to these textures is that they are read from the GPU making them ideal candidates for playing back complex animation. The downside is in order for the results to be accurate, these textures need to be uncompressed which can take up signifcant memory.

@parameters
    User Interface:
        Simple (Default) shows a limited UI of the parameters that would be changed the most often.
        Normal is a fully expanded UI with more in-depth but less used controls.
    Start/End:
        This is the begining and end frame of the export. Please account for the one frame offset of the start frame to the end frame. By default the exporter will break the dynamic variables on creation.
    Render With Take:
        If you are using takes you can change the exporter options.
    Method:
        What primary method to export for: 
        
        Soft - Consistant Topology throughout the Simulation.
        
        Rigid - Packed Primitive style Rigid Body Simulation.
        
        Fluid - Changing Topology throughout the Simulation.
        
        Sprite - Camera facing cards, points moving through space.
    Engine:
        Set the scale, texture type and coordinate system specific to the game engine chosen.
    Initialize for Engine:
        Applies the preset option for each engine. Make sure to do this as soon as possible as the result will overwrite parameters in the UI.
    SOP Path:
        The path to your geometry in sops.
    == Data For Realtime Material ==
    NOTE:
        Any value that needs to be copied to your game-engine material has a copy button next to it.
    Frame Range:
        The number of calculated frames. Your last frame minus your start frame. This value will be set by a script when you click Render.
    Speed:
        The rate in houdini of your frames per second divided by your frame range. In your engine this may vary if your frame rate is different or varying. This value will be set by a script when you click Render.
    Position Min/Max:
        Copy these values to the material in your game-engine to expand normalised position values back to their original range.
    Pivot Min/Max:
        Visible when the Rigid method has been chosen. Pivot values are stored in the vertex colour. Most game engines will clamp these values between 0 and 1. Copy these values to the material in your game-engine to expand normalised pivot values back to their original range.
    Scale Max/Min:
        Visible when the Rigid method has been chosen. Remaps the max and min scale over the course of the entire time range.
    Width/Height:
        Visible when the Sprite method has been chosen and the Engine is set to Unity. Set width and height from houdini for your sprite scale.
    Active Pixels:
        When Pad to Power of 2 is activated these values represent the pixel dimensions of the original texture. These value will be set by a script when you click Render.
    Padded Size:
        When Pad to Power of 2 is activated this is the smallest power of 2 value for each axis. The material will use these numbers to calculate a ratio for the uv lookup. These value will be set by a script when you click Render.
    Normalize data range to 0-1 space:
        If you intend to use texture compression then normalized data is required for your texture maps.
    Pack normals into Position Alpha:
        Stores the normal data in the alpha channel of the position map to save texture space. This method will result in less accurate normals.
    Pack Pscale into Position Alpha:
        Stores the pscale data into the alpha channel of the position map to save texture space.
    Pad to Power of 2:
        When activated all textures will be exported to the nearest power of 2 value in each axis. Power of two textures allows for texture streaming on the GPU.
    Double Textures (Higher Precision):
        If your engine is limited to 8bit textures, a second texture can be used for higher precision.
    Target Texture Size:
        This is the maximum width of your texture. The height is dictated by the number of frames of your animation and the number of vertices relative to your maximum width.
    Target Prim Count:
        This is the maximum number of triangles that will be used for your fluid export mesh. Ideally this number should be less than the triangle count of the input mesh.
    Calculate Optimal Primcount:
        This will set the target prim count value to the total number of triangles on the current frame of the input mesh.
    == Paths ==
    enable_project:
        Enable asset name override.
    Project:
        Your parent project directory, by default this is the $JOB for those studios that use it.
    Component Enable:
        This allows you to override the Asset name in the file path. This is typically 'opname("..")', the parent node of this sop area. This allows you to copy and paste this render object or unique asset as many times as you need. If within a subnet this will reflect the subnet name.
    Component:
        By default this will refer to the name of the parent object, or subnet of this node, so you can perform a lot of copy and paste name space tricks to duplicate assets. If you need you can override the Asset name and enter any string or expression you need in there.
    enable_geo:
        Enable export of geometry.
    Geometry:
        Path on disk to save the geometry.
    Browse Path:
        Opens an explorer window to the listed directory
    enable_pos:
        Enable export of position.
    Position:
        Path on disk to save the position map.
    Position2:
        If Double Textures is enabled, the path on disk to save the second position map.
    enable_rot:
        Enable export of rotation.
    Rotation:
        Path on disk to save the rotation map.
    enable_scale:
        Enable export of scale.
    Scale:
        Allow your exported mesh to have pre-scale to the mesh, besides defaulting at origin.
    enable_normal:
        If disabled Normal is packed into Alpha. Enable export of normal map.
    Normal:
        Path on disk to save normal map, when not using the packed normals in the alpha of the position map.
    Export Color Map:
        Enable export of color.
    Color:
        Path on disk to save the color map.
    Update Mat:
        Enable export of material instance for engines that support it, and this will update the values in the material instances for engines that allow it.
    Material:
        The copy and paste material code for the engine.
    Create Data:
        Enable export of data for the realtime shader to a json library so you can source control it.
    Realtime Data:
        Path on disk to save the data for the real time shader.
    Create Shader:
        Enable creation of the shader for engine that allow it.
    Shader Path:
        Path on disk to save the shader.
    == Settings ==
    Initialize Simulation OPs:
        Triggers all simulation contexts to run in the cook chain prior to export.
    Equalize Edges:
        For fluid exports. This will even the edges of the triangles for the best compression.
    Reverse Normals:
        Reverses the normals on the mesh. Helpful for one sided meshes like sprites.
    Convert to Image Format's Colorspace:
        This removes any sRGB lookup that are default for the formats.
    Raster Depth:
        This will be set when Initialize for Engine is clicked. Adjust the bitdepth for the image to be exported.
    Black/White Points:
        The min and max pixels values for the exported image. This does not remap the textures to fit.
    BC 4Channel Split:
        Renders the channels separately for different data formats.
    Position Coord:
        This will be set when Initialize for Engine is clicked. Re-order the components for different coordinate systems.
    Color Coord:
        Re-order the components for different coordinate systems. For color this maybe be helpful if you are hijacking this map for other purposes besides color.
