CSV (comma separated values) is a common low level interchange format when no other format is available. It can be easily loaded as spreadsheet form into tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, and most scripting languages have built in support for reading CSV files.

This ROP exports @P for selected geometry by default, or can export custom attributes if required. It also gives simple control over the formatting, but if more complex export formatting is required a python sop might be more appropriate; the script code in this HDA can be used as reference to build a custom CSV exporter.


@parameters
    Render:
        Export a CSV file to the specified location.

         Houdini path of the geometry to be exported.
    CSV Path:
        Location and name to save the CSV file.
    Separate Vector Components:
        Export the vector components into separate columns of a spreadsheet when enabled. If disabled, vectors will be saved in curly braces, eg {1,2,3}.
    Component Suffixes:
        Suffix to use for vector components, so if the suffix is x, and the vector is P, the column name will be Px.

        When enabled use the following multiparm to define which attributes to export, otherwise just export @P.
    Attribute:
