""" Render an image sequence and assemble it as a single sheet (subUv, flipbook) """

A common workflow is to render out an image sequence and then assemble the sequence into a single sheet using the Mosaic node. 

This node automates that process by combining the whole process into a single button, it also allows to render out normal maps both through the volumes or RGB lights.

    Sequence Directory:
        Working directory for the individual images 
    Render Sequence:
        Triggers rendering only the color sequence 
    Render N Sequence:
        Triggers rendering only the normal images sequence 
    Render RGB Sequence:
        Triggers rendering only the RBG lights images sequence 
    Export Normal:
        Toggles rendering out the normals from the volume
    Render RGB Lights (Normals):
        Toggles the rendering out of the normals from RGB lights
    Render Emission Layer:
        Toggles rendering the emission values of the fire
    == Maps ==
    Channel Pack Normal, Emission, Alpha:
        Toggles packing different maps together, this can be setup under the Channel Packing Tab
    Map Directory:
        Path to the final output directory, where the compiled sheets will be written out to
    Render Color Map:
        Triggers the assembling of the color map
    Render Normal Map:
        Triggers the assembling of the normal map
    Render Packed Map:
        Triggers the assembling of the packed map
    == Nodes ==
    Node To Render:
        SOP to be included in the rendering
    Camera:
        Camera object to be used for rendering
    == Settings ==
    Start/End/Inc:
        Allows you to set your desired export frame range.
    Images per Line:
        Number of Columns on the final sheet 
    Resolution:
        Size of the final sheet
    No. Of Frames:
        *READ ONLY* Display of how many frames will be assembled
    Atlas Layout:
        *READ ONLY* Display of how many rows vs columns on the final sheet
    Override Camera Resolution (Based on Atlas Settings):
        If this is turned on the camera resolution will match the settings for the final texture atlas.
    Camera Resolution:
        *READ ONLY* Display of the camera resolution for each frame 
    Override Resolution:
        *READ ONLY* Display of the actual render resolution for each frame (could be changed by turning on Override Camera Resolution) 
    == Render Settings == 
    These are all promoted up from the [Mantra ROP |Node:out/ifd]
  
    == Channel Packing == 
    
    Set Composite View:
        Button to setup a COP network preview to visualize the channel packing of the final texture. 
    Texture Preview:
        Select which map to preview
    Reload Sequences:
        Refresh the sequence files 
    Red:
        In the packed Map, what does the red channel represent
    Green:
        In the packed Map, what does the green channel represent
    Blue:
        In the packed Map, what does the blue channel represent
    Alpha:
        In the packed Map, what does the alpha channel represent
    Blend N and RGB Lights:
        Blend between the volume normals and the light based normals
