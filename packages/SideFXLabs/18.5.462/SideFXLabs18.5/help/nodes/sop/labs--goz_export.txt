""" Sends Houdini Mesh data automatically to Zbrush """

== Overview ==


[GoZ|http://docs.pixologic.com/user-guide/zbrush-other-programs/goz/about-goz/] is Zbrush's built in system for sending data between Zbrush and 3rd party software using the GoZ file format. 

The GameDev tools implements a file format plugin, which enables the File SOP to read and write GoZ files. But there is also a bridge mechanism to trigger the loading of the files and the possibility of sending multiple files at once. 

== Installation ==

Some files are copied over to "C:\Users\Public\Pixologic\GoZApps\Houdini" the first time you drop a GoZ Export Node. 

On the Zbrush Side, you can set it up by hitting the GoZ button if this is the first time you've ran GoZ and you will be prompted to find the Houdini path. 

You can choose any of the provided houdiniXXX.exe but ensure it's the right version number if you have multiple installed. 


== Data Conversion == 

=== Geometry Data === 

	The following attributes are passed across both ways
	
	* Point Positions
	* PolyPaint (`Cd` Point Attribute)
	* Mask (`mask` Point Attribute) 
	* PolyGroups (`polygroup` Primitive Attribute) 
	* UVs (`uv` Vertex Attribute) 
	

=== SubTools ===

	Subtools are defined by the `name` Primitive Attribute. Different name values will yield separate subtools 
	
NOTE: 
	The plugin is only supported on Windows at this time.
