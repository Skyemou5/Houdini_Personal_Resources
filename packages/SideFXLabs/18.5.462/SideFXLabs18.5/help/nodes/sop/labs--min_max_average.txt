""" Multiple Min/Max/Average Analysis in a single node """

Finding out what's the Min or Max value of an attribute is a common operation. Traditionally this is done with an [Attribute Promote SOP|Node:sop/attribpromote]

The [Attribute Promote SOP|Node:sop/attribpromote] can be a bit cumbersome to string several together in case you want both min and Max values, and sometimes you might want those values back on the points instead of sitting on the detail attribute.
