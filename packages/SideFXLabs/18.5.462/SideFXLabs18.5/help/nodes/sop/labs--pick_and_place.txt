""" Allows you to interactively place individual objects in a scene. """

Pick and Place is an interactive tool that allows you to "Pick and Place" objects in a scene. The first input of the tool has the incoming collision geometry (your scene), and the second input has the objects you would like to place.
Once you enter the state of the tool (select the node and hit enter in the viewport), you can click and drag on the objects in the scene to place, scale and rotate them. Scrollwheel allows you to switch between the input object to be placed.

It is highly recommended you plug in packed primitives as the geometry to place.


TIP:
    Rightclick in the viewport while being in the tool state to change the behavior on scaling and rotating.

TIP:
    Holding CONTROL will allow you to move around previously placed objects by simply dragging them around. If you then also hold SHIFT (without letting go of CONTROL), will allow you to rotate and scale them too.

@parameters
    ID:
        The object number to be used for placement in this multiparm entry. The object number is calculated internally in the tool based on mesh connectivity.
    Align to Surface:
        This controls if the placed object gets aligned to the surface it got placed on.
