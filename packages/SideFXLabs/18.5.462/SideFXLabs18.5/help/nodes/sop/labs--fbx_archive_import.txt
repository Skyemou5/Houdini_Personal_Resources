"""  Import an FBX as an archive similar to how the Alembic Archive sop works.  """

Import an FBX as an archive similar to how the Alembic Archive sop works. This allows you to import materials for FBX files, which the file sop doesnt, and also preserves hierarchy.

@parameters
    == Import Settings ==
    Reload Geometry:
        This reloads the geometry from disk. Useful when you changed the file on disk and want to reimport.
    FBX File:
        The path to the file on disk.
    Import Materials:
        Import materials and textures.
    Embedded Import:
        When this checkbox is ticked, the FBX will be imported into an embedded objnet in this HDA. Otherwise the FBX will be imported on the /Obj level and objectmerged into this HDA's output.
    Import Animation:
        Import animation, including vertex cache files.
    Convert to Y up:
        If checked, the entire FBX scene will be converted to the Y-up coordinate system. If unchecked, the scene will be imported as-is.
    Unlock Geometry:
        Leaves all imported File and Capture SOPs unlocked after import. This means that FBX geometry is referenced from the original FBX file on disk, and is not stored in Houdini HIP file. Note that for skinned objects, point weights will not be re-imported when the File SOP re-cooks, and are always stored as a copy in the Override SOP.
