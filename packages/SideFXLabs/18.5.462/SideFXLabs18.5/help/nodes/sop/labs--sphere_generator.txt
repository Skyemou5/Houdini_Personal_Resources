""" The sphere generator creates a sphere from a cube with uv's and normals. """

The sphere generator deforms a cube into the shape of a sphere so that uv's can be laid out in a cross shape. Just like the regular sphere, you can change the levels of division. You can also modify the normals, cut it based on a plane and add vertex color based on one of the axes.

@parameters
    == Settings ==
    Subdivisions:
        Increases or decreases the number of polygons which make up a polygonal sphere. The higher the frequency, the smoother the sphere.
    Uniform Scale:
        Scale equally in all axes.
    Scale:
        Non-uniform scaling along xyz axes.
    Cusp Angle:
        When computing vertex normals, if normals of vertices around a single point are less than or equal to this angle (in degrees) apart from each other, they will be averaged together, weighted by the vertex angle in each polygon.
    Cut Sphere:
        Enable clipping the sphere.
    Cut Position:
        Where to cut the sphere, relative to the bounding box of the sphere
    Cut Direction:
        The axis direction perpendicular to the cutting plane, similar to the clip node.
    == Vertex Colour ==
    Add Colour:
        Create a vertex attribute, Cd.
    Ramp Axis:
        The cardinal axis that drives the colour ramp. x = 0, y = 1, z = 2
