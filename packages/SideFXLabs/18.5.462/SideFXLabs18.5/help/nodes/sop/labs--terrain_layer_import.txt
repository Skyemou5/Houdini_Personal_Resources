""" The terrain layer import SOP exports a heightfield with the correct settings from Unreal. """

The terrain layer export SOP imports a heightfield with the correct settings from Unreal. It does so by properly orienting the heightmap prior to import, and also remaps it into the expected range (0-256).
This tool is designed to work together with Terrain Layer Export.
