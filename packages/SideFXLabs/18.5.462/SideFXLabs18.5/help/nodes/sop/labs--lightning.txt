""" Generate lightning effect around meshes """

== Overview ==

[Image:/images/lightning.png]

The tool can generate lightning geometry around a given input. By controlling the start and end point, you can guide the effect. This tool is useful for lightning effects in game engines.

TIP:
    Used in the [Sci-Fi Core Tutorial| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZRH7fLLi3w]

@parameters
    == Settings ==
	== Setup ==
    	Start Point:
       		Start location of the lightning.
    	End Point:
       		End location of the lightning.
    	Lightning Arcs:
       		Amount of lightning arcs around an object.
	== Contact Spread ==
		== Start Point ==
    		Spread:
       			Increase the area where points can spawn.
    		Relax Scatter:
       			Relax the scattered point at the start location.
    		Debug begin spread:
       			Visualize how much the area of the spread is affecting.
		== End Point ==
    		Spread:
       			Increase the area where points can spawn.
    		Relax Scatter:
       			Relax the scattered point at the end location.
    		Debug begin spread:
       			Visualize how much the area of the starting spread is affecting.
                Debug end spread:
       			Visualize how much the area of the end spread is affecting.
    	Shape along lines:
       		Ramp to scale the radius of the Lightning arcs.
    	Beam Thickness:
       		Scale the overall radius of the lightning arcs.
    	Columns:
       		Controls the number of columns and divisions on the lightning arcs.
    	Curve Section Length:
       		Resolution of the Ligthning arcs.
    	Distance from model:
       		Target distance to push the lightning from or to the input model.
    	Length until end:
       		Lowering thhe value will control how far the ligthning will go.
    	Push End:
       		Pushing the end points away from other points.
    	Push Falloff:
       		When pushing the end points this value will control the falloff.
	== Vertex Colors ==
    	Red Channel:
        	Option to control what information is stored in the vertex color.
    	Green Channel:
        	Option to control what information is stored in the vertex color.
    	Blue Channel:
        	Option to control what information is stored in the vertex color.
    == Noise ==
	Add noise:
		Enables mesh noise on the lightning.
	Noise Type:
		Menu to choose different types of noises.
	Height:
		Controls the height or intensity of the noise.
	Element Size:
		Scaling frequency of the noise.
	Roughness:
		The higher this value the more noise on the lightning.
	Scale:
		Scale the noise is each axis.
	Clipping Minimum:
		Clamp the noise to a minimum value.
	Clipping Maximum:
		Clamp the noise to a maximum value.
   	 == Stick To Surface ==
	Start range:
	    Range of how many starting points stick to the surface of the input.
	Stick to Surface:
            Strength to blend points on the surface of the input.
	End range:
	    Range of how many end points stick to the surface of the input.
	Stick to Surface:
	    Strength to blend points on the surface of the input.
	Add Jitter:
	    Enable jitter noise.
	Scale:
	    Scale of the jitter.
	Axis Scales:
	    Scale the jitter on a per axis basis.
    == Previews ==
	Show Input:
		Show the input geometry.
	Tint Blue:
		Color the Lightning blue.
	Preview modes:
		Modes the see the lightning result better.
    == Export ==
	Save to Disk:
		Export to model to the given location on disk.
	Model name:
		Name of the model.
	Output File:
		Location to save the output to.
	Export in ASCII Format:
		Enable this to export ASCII Format instead of Binary.

@outputs
    Output 1:
        Outputs the Lightning geometry and vertex colors for the game engine.
