""" The Detail Mesh SOP allows you to project a so called detail mesh onto template geometry. """

The Detail Mesh SOP allows you to project a so called detail mesh onto template geometry. The tool will analyze your template and will based on its uvs, project the detail mesh onto it to create the output. While doing this, it will also try and resolve any seams that get created due to the input uvs.

@parameters
    == Tiling ==
    Tile Scale:
        This controls how much tiling you want to happen with your detail mesh. Higher value means that the detail mesh tile will be repeated more frequently across your template geometry.
    Tile Rotate:
        This allows you to globally rotate the projected detail mesh in UV space.
    Mask By Color:
        This toggle enables or disables the masking of the projection based on Vertex Color (Cd).
    Tile Depth Scalar:
        This scalar allows you to scale the projected detail mesh in the local-space Z axis. 
    == Seam ==
    Strength:
        Controls the smoothing iterations of the generated seam geometry.
    Override Seam Material:
        Allows you to enable a special material for the generated seam geometry.
    Seam Material:
        Allows you to specify a special material for the generated seam geometry.
    == Post Process ==
    Cusp Angle:
        Controls the cusping angle used for the generated normals.
    Post Triangulate:
        Allows you to triangulate the output mesh.
