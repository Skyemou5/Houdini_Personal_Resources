This hda will identify edges that are flat, and dissolve them. The default behavior is to only find perfectly flat edges. The max edge angle slider allows a threshold of 'flatness', so edges which are mostly flat can also be dissolved, or the threshold can be set higher to obtain different effects, say artisticly driven decimation.

@parameters
    Max Edge Angle:
        Threshold of 'flatness'. 0 means edges have to be perfectly flat, higher numbers will find more edges and dissolve them.
