"""  Quickly tile geometry on a planar surface. """

This tool takes geometry scattered on a planar surface (square or rectangle) and makes it tile around the edges. This is extremely useful for making tileable pieces of geometry that doesn't overlap, or for texture baking.

@parameters
    == General ==
    Tile Mode:
	Choose between Full Tile and Piece Tile. Full tile is useful for baking, while Piece Tile is useful for instancing tiled pieces as geometry.
    X Tile Side:
	When Tile mode is set to Piece Tile, this controls if the positive or negative side of the tile on the X axis should be populated.
    Z Tile Side:
	When Tile mode is set to Piece Tile, this controls if the positive or negative side of the tile on the Z axis should be populated.
    Planar Surface:
	This controls whether or not the input surface will be part of the output.
    Tile Edge Density:
	This parameter allows you to control the density of the geometry tiled around the border. Sometimes the border becomes more densely populated than the center when tiled which might produce visible patterns. 
   == Debug ==
   Quick Tiling Debug:
	This toggle will show you a quick preview of how the tile result looks like when the output data is tiled in a 3x3 grid.
   Color Tile Meshes:
        Controls if the preview should have the tiled borders masked red.
   Debug Resolution:
        Controls the resolution of the debug preview Heightfield. Useful for performance reasons.
