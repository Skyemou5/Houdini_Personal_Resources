"""  Loads a Substance Archive and assigns it as a material """

The Substance Material sop is a wrapper around the substance archive cop, which loads all the common imageplanes and assigns them as maps in the PBR shader called Principledshader.
The tool also promotes all parameters present in the loaded archive, so you can tweak them while looking at your material assigned in the viewport.
