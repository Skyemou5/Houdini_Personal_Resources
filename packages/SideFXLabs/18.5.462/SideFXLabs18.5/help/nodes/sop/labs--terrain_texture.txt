""" The Terrain Texture rop SOP renders image data from a heightfield. """

The Terrain Texture rop SOP renders image data from a heightfield as opposed to for example the Terrain Segment rop SOP which creates geometry.

@parameters
    == Normal Map ==
    Tangent Normal Flip Y:
        Flips the Y axis value of the normal map.
    Tangent Normal Flip X:
        Flips the X axis value of the normal map.
    Use MikkT Tangent Space:
        Enables / Disables the use of MikkT Tangent space normalmap.
    == Texture Maps ==
    Output File:
        This specifies the output file.
    Export:
        This toggle enables / disables the exporting of the map next to the toggle.
    == Height Map ==
    Normalize Range 0-1:
        This enables / disables the remapping of the rendered values to 0-1 space. When disabled and the image is exporting as HDR (Ex EXR), this uses world-space values. 
    Single Channel:
        Enables the exporting of the heightmap as a single channel image.
    Raster Depth:
        Controls the precision used for the exported heightmap values.
    == Output ==
    Divide into tiled maps:
        This allows for the to be exported maps to be divided into tiles.
    Number of Tiles:
        This specifies the number of tiles the exported images need to be divided in. Only applicable when "Divide into tiled maps" is enabled.
    Render Resolution:
        This specifies the total resolution of the exported images.
