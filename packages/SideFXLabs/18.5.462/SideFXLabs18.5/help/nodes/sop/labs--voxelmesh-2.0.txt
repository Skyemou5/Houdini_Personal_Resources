""" Convert a Polygon Mesh into a Volume and back into Polygons """

A very common node chain is [VDB From Polygons|Node:sop/vdbfrompolygons], followed immediately by a  [Convert VDB|Node:sop/convertvdb]

This converts your mesh into a Volume and then back to a Mesh. Doing so has the following benefits: It can close small holes in the mesh, give you new even topology and remove interior geometry. 

VoxelMesh is often used to sanitize photogrammetry data, as it will often fix small imperfections on the mesh. 


NOTE: 
    UVs are generally destroyed while going through the VDB roundtrip. If you would like to transfer UVs from the original mesh back onto the Voxelized, take a look at the [UV Transfer Node|Node:sop/labs--uv_transfer]


@parameters
    Resolution:
        This sets the number of voxels to be generated on the longest axis of the mesh. Note that this is scale independent.
    == VDB Smoothing ==
    Dilate/Erode:
        This allows you to expand (dilate) or contract (erode) the geometry along the surface normal of the VDB volume.
    Smoothing Iterations:
        The number of smoothing operations to be applied to the VDB before meshing. This can help remove high frequency details.
    == Meshing ==
    Adaptivity:
        Controls how even the topology of the resulting mesh is. High Adaptivity values mean concentration around areas of high curvature, low curvature means even distribution of polygons

    Transfer Surface Attributes:
        This will attempt to transfer any attributes found on the input geometry onto the VDB remeshed geometry.
    Sharpen Features:
        Geometry tends to soften when being voxelized, because some features might sit in between voxels. This strengthens the features and is helpful on hard surfaces.
        [Image:/images/voxelmesh_sharpenfeatures.png]
    Edge Tolerance:
        Tolerance for what edges to consider for the Sharpen Features toggle.
    Project to Original:
        Optionally Ray the resulting mesh back onto the original 
    Post Smooth Iterations:
        The Projection step can generate some undesirably overlapping polygons, this step can relax some of those polygons
