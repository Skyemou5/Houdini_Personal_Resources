""" Orients a mesh based on UP and FRONT groups """

During photogrammetry workflows it is common to be faced with a mesh that is oriented arbitrarily. 

Traditionally the best way of dealing with that is with a transform node and manually orienting the mesh and visually ensuring that it is oriented properly. 

The Straighten SOP aims to assist in that workflow by letting the user define a group of polygons that are facing up, and an optional group of polygons facing forward. 

The node will then figure out all of the appropriate rotations, in order for the *average of the normals* of the up group be facing up, and the same for the front group. 

TIP: 
	Selecting different disconnected areas that have similar normals helps with the orientation

@parameters
    Group Type:
        Type of Primitive for the group, Primitive, Edge or Point
    Up Group:
        Group Name or Geometry Selection that defines what UP means in this mesh
    Invert Up Axis:
        Toggle to orients the mesh towards -Y instead of +Y 
    Align Forward:
        Toggle to additionally orient the mesh forward as well as up. Controls the Y rotation of the mesh
    Forward Group:
        Group Name or Geometry Selection that defines what FORWARD means in this mesh
