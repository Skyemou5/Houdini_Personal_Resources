""" Makes disconnected geometry lying on a plane tileable. """

The Mesh Tiler takes a collection of meshes which have been distributed on a planar surface (Doesn't need to be square) and make it tileable. This result then allows you to copy this new "tile", without getting any obvious seams. This is especially useful for baking down a tile you scatter a set of high-resolution meshes on. Or if you just want a nice tileable mesh.

@parameters
    == General ==
    Tile Mode:
        This controls the type of output that will be produced from the tool. Full tile will make the output fully tileable (Used for baking), and Piece Tile will produce an output similar to a puzzle piece.
    X Tile Side:
        Controls at which side the X axis should be tiling.
    Z Tile Side:
        Controls at which side the Z axis should be tiling.
    Planar Surface:
        Enabling this toggle will also export the planar surface used to tile around.
    Tile Edge Density:
        This slider controls what percentage of the geometry that got tiled should be kept. Lowering this number can reduce the appearance of a thicker border on the tile.
    == Debug ==
    Quick Tiling Debug:
        Enabling this will generate a heightfield from the output. This is useful for previewing what the result of a baked heightmap would look like. Easy to spot issues.
    Color Tile Meshes:
        This will color the border geometry on the generated heightfield red.
    Debug Resolution:
        Controls the resolution of the generated debug Heightfield.
