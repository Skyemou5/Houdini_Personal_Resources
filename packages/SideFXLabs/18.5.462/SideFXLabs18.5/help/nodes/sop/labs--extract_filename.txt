""" Utility SOP to store the filename of a file SOP as its detail attributes to be then used in other SOPs. """

This utility SOP makes extracting filenames from files imported with a file sop very easy. This is extremely useful when processing large number of meshes in batch, and you want to utilize file names for ex baking outputs.
