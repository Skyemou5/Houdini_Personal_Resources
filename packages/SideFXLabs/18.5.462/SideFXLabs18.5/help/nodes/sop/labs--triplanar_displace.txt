""" Displacing geometry based on a triplanar projection """

Triplanar Displace will apply a displacement map onto your geometry using a projection from the three main axis. It will then displace your geometry based on the displacement amount specified in the texture.
This is a very useful workflow for upressing geometry without making UVs.

@parameters
    == Settings == 
    Displacement:
        Specifies the displacement texture used during the projection. This is typically a greyscale texture.
    Color:
        An optional color map that matches the displacement map.
    Texture Scale:
        The scale of the texture used for the projection. A lower value means less tiling (zoom in), while a higher value means more tiling.
    Displacement Amount:
        A scalar on the displacement value read in the displacement texture specified.
    Axis Blend:
        Controls the strength of the displacement on the seams of the projection. A higher value means more blending, and therefore less seams. Setting this value too high will make the seams too flat.
    == Advanced ==
    Axis Offset:
        Allows for offsetting the UV position sampled for the displacement texture.
    Displace Y:
        Enables or Disables displacement on the Y axis.
    Smooth Normals:
        Enabling this will calculate smooth normals, to be used as the direction of displacement.
    Mirror X Axis:
        Enabling this will produce identical results on the opposing X axis sides. 
    Mirror Z Axis:
        Enabling this will produce identical results on the opposing Z axis sides. 

    == Noise Projection Offset ==
    Use Noise Projection Offset:
        Enabling this will distort the projection sample based on noise before displacing. This helps getting rid of any obvious tiling artifacts, and produce a more organic look.
    == Displacement Scale Attribute ==
    Use Displacement Scale Attribute:
        Enabling this will scale the sampled displacement amount based on noise before displacing. This helps getting rid of any obvious tiling artifacts, and produce a more organic look.
    	NOTE:
            This does require you to have an attribute containing noise.
