""" Sharpens the geometry based on curvature"""

[Image:/images/mesh_sharpen.jpg]

The Mesh Sharpen tool sharpens the geometry based on the curvature found on the mesh. It does so by pushing the points on the mesh towards the higher curvature regions, therefore "sharpening" those regions.
During this process, some of the volume of the geometry might be lost, but this can be somewhat restored using the smoothing parameters, while keeping the sharpness.

@parameters
    == Sharpening ==
    Step Size:
        Rate at which the geometry gets sharpened each step. Going over .5 will lead to instability due to overshooting
    Iterations:
        Number of curvature sharpening iterations to apply.
    Pin Borders:
        Preserves any borders. This will for example ensure that sharpening a hemisphere will keep the open edges at their original position.
    == Smoothing ==
    Iterations:
        Number of smoothing iterations.
    Step Size:
        Size of smoothing steps to take at each iteration.
    == Advanced ==
    Use OpenCL:
        Use OpenCL for the smoothing. Turning this off might make the processing a little slower, but will use VEX instead.
    Curvature Type:
        Controls the method used to calculate curvature.
    Make Scale Independent:
        Ensures the calculated curvature is mesh scale independent.
    Curvature Exponent:
        Allows you to tweak the exponent that is applied to the curvature. Higher value means higher curvature regions get priority over other regions when sharpening.
