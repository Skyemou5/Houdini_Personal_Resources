""" A scan of Paul Ambrosiussen """

This geometry is a scan of Paul Ambrosiussen, who is one of the developers of the GameDevToolset/SideFXLabs. The scan can be used for all sorts of testing purposes. If you hurt the developer, he will haunt you in your dreams.
Big thanks to Will Driscoll, who did the scan.
