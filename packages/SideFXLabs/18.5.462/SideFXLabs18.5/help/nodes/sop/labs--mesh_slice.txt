""" Clips the geometry into multiple submeshes based on a 3d grid pattern """

This node will slice up your mesh into several subcomponents based on a 3D grid defined by its bounding box

This is a combination of the Multi Bounding Box node and a Box Clip node working in conjunction to let you generate submeshes from one large mesh. 

The most common use case is a large photogrammetry asset or point cloud that you might need chunked up into smaller meshes, either for streaming or for drawing/processing optimizations

@parameters
    Divisions:
        Number of XYZ Divisions for the 3d Grid 
    Fill Holes:
        Toggle to enable capping the clipped faces.
    Isolate Index:
        Isolate a single sub component (Helpful if you'd like to use a ROP to drive this node and split out the mesh with the $F expression) 
    Visualize Pieces:
        Applies a random Color to each of the pieces in order to quickly visualize how the mesh is split
