""" Color sharp edges on geometry """

:video:

Edge Color will highlight sharp changes in geometry, with control over contrast and blur. It also lets you identify convex vs concave edges, and treat them seperately. 

Note that it requires as reasonable amount of subdivision between the required edges. The color is stored as a @Cd point attribute, so if there isn't enough internal detail per flat region, there won't be enough points to isolate the edges from the rest of the geometry.


@parameters
    Mask Color:
        Color to use for edges.
    Blend Mode:
        Method to blend the colors
    == Convex  ==
    Intensity:
        Intensity to mask convex edges.
    Contrast:
        How much contrast to add, making edge masking appear thinner or thicker.
    Blur Amount:
        Amount to blur and soften the result.
    == Concave ==
    Blur Amount:
        Amount to blur and soften the result.
