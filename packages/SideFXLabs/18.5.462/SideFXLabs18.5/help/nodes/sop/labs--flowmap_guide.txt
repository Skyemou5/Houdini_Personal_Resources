""" The Guide Flowmap modifies a flowmap based on a guide curve. """

The Guide Flowmap tool takes a flowmap as its primary input, and a guide curve as its second input. The tool will then modify the flowmap based on the provided curve and settings.
This is a very powerful procedural approach to creating flowmaps independent of the flowmap resolution.

@parameters
    Strength:
        Controls the intensity of the effect of guide on the already existing flowmap.
    Effect Width:
        This is the base influence distance. Any points closer than the Effect Width value will receive full influence by the guide curve.
    Falloff:
        This falloff allows you to create a gradient falloff beyond the Effect Width distance. A convenient way to smooth the edges of the guide curve influence.
    Guide Sample Count:
        This controls the number of samples takes from the guide curve. A higher value means higher precision values.
    Reverse Direction:
        This allows you to reverse the direction of the provided guide curve influence, without having to modify the incoming curve in any way.
