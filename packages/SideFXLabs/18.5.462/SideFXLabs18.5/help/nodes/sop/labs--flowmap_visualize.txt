"""  A high quality realtime preview of a flowmap texture in the Houdini viewport. """

:video:

The flowmap tools in Houdini work per-point, while the final result in a game engine will be run per pixel. This HDA allows you to preview the final per-pixel effect at high quality. 

The only requirement is that the flowmap data has been converted to @Cd, which can be done with the 'Flowmap to Color' sop. This HDA provides extra controls for speed, distortion, and while it ships with a preview water texture, allows you to use your own water surface preview texture.

@parameters
    Diffuse Texture:
        Texture to preview flowmap, default is to use a texture embedded in the HDA.
    Diffuse Tiling:
        Number of times the texture repeats in the uv's of the input geometry.
    Speed:
        Speed of the flowmap animation.
    Distortion Amount:
        Amount of warping applied to the flowmap preview. Larger values create a more pronounced effect, but can introduce ghosting artifacts.
    Flowmap Mode:
        Set if this node reads motion vectors from @Cd of the input geometry, or from a file texture.
    Flowmap Texture:
        Path to the flowmap texture.
