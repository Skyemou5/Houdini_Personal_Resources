""" Split primitives into separate outputs based on normals """

The split primitives by normal looks at the primitive normals of the input geometry, and splits them into separate outputs based on the normals. This is a very useful tool for hard-surface modeling, scattering or even just isolating geometry.

@parameters
    == Settings ==
    Direction:
        This allows you to specify the direction of the normal for the primitives that should be split off.
    Invert Selection:
	Inverts the selection generated based on the Direction parameter.
    Tolerance:
	This allows you to control the deviation from the direction specified in the Direction parameter that is allowed for the splitting.
