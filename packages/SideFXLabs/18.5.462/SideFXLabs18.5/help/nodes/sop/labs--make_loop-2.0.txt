""" Takes a mesh or volume that is animated and loops them """

This node will make either a mesh, volume or particle effect loop. 

The general idea is that it will offset the animation by half of the timeline and then do a sinewave to blend between the two animations. 

This will work with meshes with constant topology or volumes, or with particles coming out of a popnet with the right attributes.

    Mesh sequence after looping applied 

NOTE:
    If you set the time range too short for particles, all particles will be removed before looping; You will therefore have to modify their lifespan settings accordingly. You need the following attributes from a particle system to get it to work: @life, @age.
