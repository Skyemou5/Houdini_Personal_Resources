""" Allows for grouping geometry based on properties that can be measured """

Group by Measure allows for easy grouping based on properties of the geometry that can be measured, such as eccentricity (squaredness). This simplifies networks from several nodes and expressions to just a single node.

@parameters
    == Group ==
    Group Name:
        The name of the group to be created or modified.
    Initial Merge:
        How to resolve collisions when modifying already created groups.
    Measure:
        The type of measure to be used for grouping.
    == Settings ==
    Invert:
        Inverts the group created from the corresponding measure.
    Eccentricity:
        The amount of squaredness of a polygon. Higher value means more square (1:1 aspect ratio).
