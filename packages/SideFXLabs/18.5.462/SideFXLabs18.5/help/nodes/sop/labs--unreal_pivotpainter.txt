""" Pivot Painter is a SOP that stores model pivot and rotation information in the model's vertex data and additional UV channels. """

Pivot Painter is a SOP that stores model pivot and rotation information in the model's vertex data and additional UV channels. That information can then be referenced inside of Unreal's shader system to create interactive effects.
This tool is specifically built to work with the material functions provided by Epic Games in Unreal Engine. It is however possible to use this encoded information in other engines such as Unity, since it uses common attributes.

@parameters
    Data Packing Method:
        This menu determines if the tool should encode PivotPainter information in the default way, or based on a custom configuration.
    Layout Lightmap UVs:
        This forces the tool to automatically generate Lightmap UVs based on the primary UVs.
    UV Padding:
        This controls the padding applied to the Lightmap UVs while they are laid out.
    == Per Object ==
    Pivot Position:
        The attribute components used to encode Pivot Position.
    Forward Axis:
        The attribute components used to encode the Forward Axis.
    Random Value:
        The attribute component used to encode a random value.
    Motion Mask:
        The attribute component used to encode the Motion Mask.
    == Hierarchical ==
    Leaf Pivot Position:
        The attribute components used to encode the Leaf Pivot Position.
    Branch Pivot Position:
        The attribute components used to encode the Branch Pivot Position.
    Branch Angle:
        The attribute components used to encode the Branch Angle.
    Use Mask:
        This toggle enables/disables the use of vertex colors for the motion mask of the object.
    Input Data:
        This menu allows you to control if you want the tool to try and generate pivot positions, or if you want to use your own.
    Branches Group:
        The primitive group containing the branches geometry.
    Leaves Group:
        The primitive group containing the leaves geometry.
