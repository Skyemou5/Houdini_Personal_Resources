""" Several Common Adjustment Operations on Vertex Colors """

This node lets you adjust the vertex colors on your models using industry standard operations that are usually done on colors. 

Really handy if you need to gamma correct vertex colors, desaturate them, or possibly modulate or enhance the output of another node, like the [Calculate Occlusion|Node:gamedev--sop_calculate_occlusion-2.0] node.

@parameters
    Group:
        Limit the operation to a specific group 
    Group Type:
        Specify if the group is a Vertex, Edge, Point or Primitive group. 
    Custom Attribute Name:
        If the attribute to be modified is different than Cd, override it here.
    Invert:
        Inverts the operation after all others operations are done (except Gamma) 
    Brightness:
        Modify the Brightness of the Vertex Colors by adding or removing this much value 
    Contrast:
        Increases the Contrast of the vertex colors by using the formula (Cd - .5 ) * contrast + .5 
    Saturation:
        Shift the colors towards grayscale or oversature the vertex colors
    Gamma:
        Exponential (Pow) function on the colors
    Clamp:
        Limit the values of the vertex colors
