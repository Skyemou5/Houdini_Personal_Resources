""" Removes pieces based on connectivity and size  """

This node calculates the size of each piece on a mesh and deletes the ones that fall below a certain size threshold. 

This is incredibly useful in Photogrammetry and Fluid Mesh cleanup, where you might have a lot of droplets or small disconnected pieces that you don't care about. 

@parameters
    == General ==
    Mode:
        How the size is determined
    Extract Largest Piece:
        Ignore the threshold and only keep the single largest piece
    Threshold:
        Pieces with the Area or Perimeter smallest than this will be removed 
    Delete Non Selected:
        Invert the operation
    == Advanced ==
    Calculate Piece Attribute:
        Toggle if the tool should be determining connectivity
    Piece Attribute:
        If the tool shouldn't be calculating connectivy, what is the attribute that determines what a piece is
