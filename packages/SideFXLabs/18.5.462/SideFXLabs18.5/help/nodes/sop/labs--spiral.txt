""" Creates a spiral curve """

The Spiral sop creates a curve that starts at the origin and spirals out for one full revolution.

@parameters
    Radius:
        Start and end width of the spiral.
    Height:
        Length of the spiral in the up-axis(y).
    Loops:
        Number of rotations from the start to end point of the loop.
    Rotation:
        Rotate the spiral around the up-axis(y). Measured in degrees.
    Scale:
        Scale the spiral in the x and z axis. Applied after the radius.
    Points:
        Control the resolution of the curve. Total number of points that make up the spiral curve.
    Helix Count:
        Total number of spirals. Distributed by dividing 360 by the number of spirals.
