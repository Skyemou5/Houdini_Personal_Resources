""" Generate polystrips on fractured geometry for extra destruction detail in game engines. """

The edge strip node will attempt to create a polystrip along the boundaries of each chunk between the inside and outside faces. Vertex alpha can be used to blend the outside material with the inside material. Make sure the uv's for the insde faces have been laid out. You can use the "inside face uv's" node to do this.

@parameters
    Merge Pieces:
        Output the edge strips and input fracture geometry.
    Inside Edge Width:
        Width of the polygon strip along the inside edge.
    Outside Edge Width:
        Width of the polygon strip along the outside edge.
