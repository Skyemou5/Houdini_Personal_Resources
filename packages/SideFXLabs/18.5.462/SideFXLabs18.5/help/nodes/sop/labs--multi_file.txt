""" Load several Geometry files at once """

The [File SOP|Node:sop/file] is limited where it can only load a single File at once. 

There are several workflows where your models might be split up into parts, or you might want to batch process a lot of files in a for loop easily. 

This node is a helper node that wraps the [File SOP|Node:sop/file] in a [For Loop|/model/looping] and will merge the contents of several File SOPs into a single piece of geometry. 

TIP: 

    You can separate and visualize the imported geometry easily with the [Align and Distribute GameDev Tool|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_align_and_distribute]
