""" This tool allows you to run geometry through InstantMeshes and generate a quad mesh. """

The InstantMeshes sop takes in geometry through its primary input, and an optional set of guide curves to control polygon flow. It will then run it through the InstantMeshes algorithm to generate a new quad mesh.

@parameters
    == Mesh Generation ==
    Target Polygon Count:
        Allows you to specify the number of desired quads.
    Crease Angle:
        Specifies the maximum generated Crease Angle used when deciding where to place edge loops.
    Number of Smooth Iterations:
        Controls the number of smoothing iterations of the geometry while meshing.
    == Advanced ==
    Output Flowlines:
        This toggle controls if the internally generated flowlines should be output.
    Deterministic:
        Controls if the meshing should be deterministic.
