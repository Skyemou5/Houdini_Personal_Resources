""" Generate the central curve (straight skeleton) for 2D input shapes. """

== Overview ==

Given some flat geometry, itâ€™s often useful to find the curve that represents the center line of that geometry, called the straight skeleton. Uses include bevelling text, defining the top edge for a house roof, center line for roads and paths.

@parameters
    Resample Size:
        Resample the input and output curves
    Trim Ends:
        Remove the Y end pieces that are common in straight skeletons
    Threshold:
        Size Threshold for deleting the end pieces
    Fit to Shape:
        Extends the skeleton ends torwards the original curve
