""" Isolates Specific OSM Data Layers """

[Open Street Map|https://www.openstreetmap.org] is an open source XML based file format for City Map data. 

The [OSM Import SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_osm_import] brings in all of the information from the OSM file. 

Sometimes that is just too much data, or you need to isolate a specific type of data, and this is where this node comes in. 

TIP: 
	Also see the [OSM Import SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_osm_import], [OSM Buildings SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_osm_buildings] and [MapBox SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_mapbox] for more OSM related workflows.
