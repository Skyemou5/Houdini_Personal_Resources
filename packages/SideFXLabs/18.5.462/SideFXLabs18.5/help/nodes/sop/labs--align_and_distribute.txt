""" Spread a collection of shapes along an axis. """

    #src:/movies/alignanddistribute.mp4

This HDA will identify individual shapes, and spread them along a user defined axis. Controls are provided to select the method for identifying individual shapes, and the direction, spacing and sorting of the spread.

@parameters
    Split By :
        How to identify elements to be distributed; by contiguous island (connectivity), or by @name.
    Sort By:
        Choose to not sort, or sort by name, or by size.
    Spacing:
        Spacing applied between each element.
    Bounding Box Relative: 
        The spacing should be based on the bounding box instead of a uniform offset
