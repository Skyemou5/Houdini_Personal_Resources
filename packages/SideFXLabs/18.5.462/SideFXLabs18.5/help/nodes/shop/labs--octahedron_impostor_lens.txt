""" This is a CVEX based Lens Shader used to generate Impostors. """

This is a CVEX based Lens Shader used to generate Impostors inside the Impostor Texture ROP. This tool by itself is exposed because of its educational worth.
Please note that the lens shader code is found in the "Code" section of the HDA.

@parameters
    xy_size:
	This specifies the number of impostor renders there are generated for both X and Y axis. (Ex 8 would result in 64 angles)
    camera_width:
	Sets the camera width of the lens shader. A larger camera width allows for larger objects to be rendered.
    camera_zoom:
	Controls the zoom of the lens. Smaller values means more zoomed in.
    imposter_mode:
	Sets the type of octahedral impostor that needs to be rendered.
