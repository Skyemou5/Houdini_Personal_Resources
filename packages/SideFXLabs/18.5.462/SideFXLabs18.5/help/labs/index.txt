"""SideFX Labs is a testing ground for over 150 tools. Our team is continuously looking for ways to help you get up and running quicker. We wrap up and release common workflows and create tight integrations with all the other software you use. Our goal is to develop prototypes that you can test out as quickly as possible. We take feedback from production artists (that's you) to adjust and improve our tools and make even more awesome stuff. """

NOTE:
	Check out our [overview page | https://www.sidefx.com/products/sidefx-labs/] to see the wide range of applications the tools provide.
== Installation ==

You can install the SideFX Labs Toolset directly from inside Houdini 18 and above. Just add the existing SideFX Labs shelf to your desktop and click on the "Update Toolset" button. You can also install it manually using the [packages system | /ref/plugins#using-package-files].

=== Shelf Updater ===
The updater provides several options for installation depending on your needs / limitations.

# Every installation of Houdini comes with a version of the SideFX Labs toolset tied to the version of Houdini. So, Houdini 18.0.345 includes version 345 of the toolset. Perfect for users who don't have permissions to download external packages.
# Download the latest production build. A production build is released every four weeks. Similar to production builds of Houdini, the toolset is generally more stable but won't include the latest additions to the toolset.
# Download the latest development build. A daily build is generally released, well, every day. These builds will contain the latest additions to the toolset including new tools, updates and bug fixes. Untick the "Production Builds Only" checkbox in the updater to see a full list of the builds available.

=== Source ===

You can also download the source and release files directly from [GitHub| https://github.com/sideeffects/SideFXLabs].
