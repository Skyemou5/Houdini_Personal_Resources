You can drag and drop colors from the color palette to assign it to a node.
Are your cook times getting slow? Use the performance monitor to see where the bottleneck is. Find it under Window>Performance Monitor.
You can link various panes to each other by right clicking the tac/pin and setting a number. Numbers pairs will stay in sync.
Press F1 while hovering a VEX function to bring the help page for it.
Holding CMD or CTRL while changing a nodes shape will set that shape as the default for all nodes of that type.
CTRL+LMB on a node to bring up the info panel; Click on an attribute on it to create a visualizer in the viewport.
CTRL+LMB on the color palette with a node selected will set all nodes of that types default color.
ALT+Shit+M Opens the cache manager where you can clear various caches.
ALT+LMB on a wire in the network editor will make a connector dot. Hold ALT while dragging the dot over multiple lines to 'collect' them into the same connector.
Pressing SHIFT+ENTER after creating a node using the tab menu will connect the created node to the node with the display flag set to it.
CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+Dragging a node will create a reference copy. This means all parameters are referenced from the copied node.
"Use `opinputpath("".."",0)` is a useful expression to get the path of the node attached to the input of the node this expression gets evaluated on. The digit in the expression controls which input to check for."
Use `vtorigin` and `vrorigin` to get the global position of anbject in parameters. Especially useful for cameras.
MMB+LMB Drag on a color parameter allows you to sample from anywhere on your screens.
Copying a node onto your clipboard using CNTRL+C will copy the node path.
"ALT+1, ALT+2, ALT+3 allows for quick switching between pane types."
Pressing P while having your mouse hover the network editor creates a resizable parameter interface in your network editor.
Shift+RMB clicking on a parameter you just changed toggles between the current and previous value.
Hold CNTRL+ALT+SHIFT while hovering UI elements to display the tooltips. LMB Clicking on them will open the hotkey manager for it.
You can press SHIFT+RMB to confirm selections.
"ALT+SHIFT+LMB on a node will select all upstream nodes. ALT+CNTRL+LMB does the same, but for downstream nodes. ALT+CNTRL+SHIFT+LMB selects both."
"SHIFT+/ launches a ""Fast Find Node"" tool.Shift+/ launches a Fast Find Node tool."
You can use underscores to nicely format large numbers. Ex: 10000000 can be written as 10_000_000 for clarity.
Object merge paths in sop solvers use special syntax. Drag the dop object from the dop spreadsheet into parameters to auto-build a path with ease!
The Box and Sphere sop inputs are used as bounding box sources to control the size of the generated box or sphere geometry.
You can drag and drop CHOPs into parameters for the easy creation of channel references.
The sprite sop is a really efficient and cheap way to visualize pscale of points/particles without copying geometry.
"Run the ""Toggle Stowbars"" tool found in the Tab menu to clean up the UI. Running that same tool again will return to normal."
Press L while your mouse hovers the network editor to automatically organize your network
Press SHIFT+S in the network editor to change the drawing style of the network wires.
You can type just the capitalized letters from a node name in the tab menu to find tools faster. AC for example returns Attribute Create.
"To find the center point of a polygon (or polygons), Use the convert node set to ""Circle"" followed by an Add node set to ""Delete Geometry But Keep the Points""."
Use an Attribute Delete to delete any unused attributes before caching data to disk to save disk-space and speed up processing.
You can use the 'vexprofile' hscript command to profile vex code.
"SHIFT+LMB click on the ""+"" icon in the Edit Parameter Interface will collapse all folders and subfolders."
Press SHIFT+R on multi-input nodes such as merge and switch to rearrange the input order.
"When creating output wires from several nodes at the same time, press ALT in the network editor to merge them."
Using $F in parameters is a quick way to try different values using the timeline. Especially in a Switch node.
"You can scale the distance used in polybevel using an attribute by setting the scaling mode next to the Distance slider to ""by attribute""."
"Drag any OBJ node into the viewport to ""drive"" / ""look through it"". While doing so, pressing \ will toggle between current and previous view."
"SideFX Houdini has a very active community. Make use of the SideFX Forum. Reddit, ODForce, RealTimeVFX and Discord."
"An easy way to find a good focus distance for cameras is to attach a grid to the camera, and link its Y axis to the focus distance."
"Open a geometry spreadsheet for a node by rightclicking it, and pressing the ""Geometry Spreadsheet"" menu option."
"You can freeze a node by pressing the ice icon on the circular menu that shows up while hovering a node. This will prevent upstream nodes from recooking. Useful for embedding geometry, but will bloat filezise."
"Attribute Randomize can create weighted randomized attribute values by setting the distribution mode to ""Custom Discrete""."
Save space on disk by compressing your volumes with the Volume Compress node! You can almost always get away with writing 16-bit volumes. (use the Primitive node to set VDBs to write as 16-bit)
